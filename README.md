All the files are from a project that is suppose to be a mobile robot-weather station, which sends the data it collects to a universal windows application. They are stored there and visualized in charts. The information can be easily analized and made into a weather forecast. The information gathered is for temperature, humidity and air pressure parameters.

The windows application is in the Software folder.
The program that needs to be loaded in the robots microcontoller is in the Firmware folder.
